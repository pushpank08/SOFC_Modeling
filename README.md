# Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) System Modeling

## Overview
This project presents a Python-based performance model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).
The model analyzes electrochemical voltage losses, power density, efficiency, and the
effect of operating temperature on fuel cell performance.

## Model Components
- Reversible cell voltage estimation
- Activation, ohmic, and concentration losses
- Polarization curve generation
- Power density calculation
- Electrical efficiency analysis
- Temperature sensitivity study (700–900°C)

## Key Engineering Insights
- Cell voltage decreases with increasing current density due to electrochemical losses
- Power density peaks at intermediate current densities
- Higher operating temperatures reduce losses but may impact material durability

## Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Energy systems modeling
- Electrochemical performance analysis

## Applications
- Fuel cell stack performance evaluation
- Combined heat and power (CHP) systems
- High-temperature energy systems
